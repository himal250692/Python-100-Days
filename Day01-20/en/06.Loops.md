## Day 6 - Loops

### `for` loop
Used when the number of iterations is known.

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

### `while` loop
Used when looping depends on a condition.

```python
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### Loop controls
- `break`: exit loop early
- `continue`: skip current iteration

```python
for n in range(1, 11):
    if n == 5:
        continue
    if n == 9:
        break
    print(n)
```
