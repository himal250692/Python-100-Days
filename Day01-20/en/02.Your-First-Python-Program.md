## Day 2 - Your First Python Program

### Where to write Python code
Common choices:
- System terminal (interactive shell)
- IPython (better interactive shell)
- VS Code
- PyCharm

### Run Python interactively
```bash
python
```
Then type:
```python
2 + 3
```
Exit with:
```python
quit()
```

### Install IPython
```bash
pip install ipython
```
Run with:
```bash
ipython
```

### First script file
Create `hello.py`:
```python
print('Hello, world!')
```
Run:
```bash
python hello.py
```

### Notes
- Interactive mode is great for experiments.
- Script files are better for real projects and version control.
