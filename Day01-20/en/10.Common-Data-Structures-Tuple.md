## Day 10 - Common Data Structures: Tuple

### What is a tuple?
A tuple is an ordered but **immutable** container.

```python
t = (35, 12, 98)
```

### Tuple operations
```python
print(len(t))
print(t[0])
print(t[-1])
print(12 in t)
```

### Single-element tuple
Be careful: `(5)` is an integer, not a tuple.

```python
a = (5,)   # correct tuple with one element
```

### Tuple vs list
- Use **tuple** for data that should not change.
- Use **list** for data that needs updates.

### Packing and unpacking
```python
person = ('Alice', 20, 'NY')
name, age, city = person
print(name, age, city)
```
