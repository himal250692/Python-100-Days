## Day 1 - Getting Started with Python

### What is Python?
Python is a programming language created by **Guido van Rossum**. It is famous for readable syntax, fast development speed, and a large ecosystem.

### A very short history
- 1989: Python project started.
- 1991: First public release.
- 2000: Python 2.0 released.
- 2008: Python 3.0 released.
- 2020: Python 2 officially reached end-of-life.

### Why learn Python?
- Easy to read and beginner-friendly.
- Huge standard library and third-party packages.
- Used in AI, web development, data science, automation, testing, and more.
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### Trade-offs
- Slower than C/C++ in many runtime-heavy tasks.
- Dynamic typing can hide some bugs until runtime.

### Install Python
1. Download Python 3 from the official website.
2. Install and check **Add Python to PATH**.
3. Verify in terminal:

```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

If a version is printed, your environment is ready.
