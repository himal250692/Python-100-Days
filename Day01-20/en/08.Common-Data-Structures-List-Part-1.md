## Day 8 - Common Data Structures: List (Part 1)

### What is a list?
A list is an ordered, mutable container.

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
```

### Access list elements
```python
print(numbers[0])   # 10
print(numbers[-1])  # 40
```

### Iterate over a list
```python
for x in numbers:
    print(x)
```

### Why use lists?
Lists help replace many repeated variables with one structured container.

### Example: dice frequency
```python
import random
freq = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
for _ in range(6000):
    face = random.randrange(1, 7)
    freq[face - 1] += 1
print(freq)
```
